# Into The Deep - FTC 2024 - 2025
This is my first year participating in FTC. I also happen to be the only coder and this robot was a big project that I had coded over the course of a month. This robot is fully driveable using 2 PS5 controllers and has fully 4 specimen scoring auto. There is still room for improvement though! We use a custom library made by a previous member from years ago and the library is quite literally his name, "om". Since the library was unmaintained I tried to write a rewrite but haven't yet tested it out over here: https://github.com/hershey-harsh/intothedeep (Using a maintained library called NextFTC)

The demo for this robot is available here: https://youtu.be/vNXQ_LnWZl8
